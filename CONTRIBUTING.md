## ‚≠ê HOW TO MAKE A PULL REQUEST:

**1.** Start by making a Fork of the [**LinkFree**](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree) repository. Click on the <a href="https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree/fork"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/G4z1kEe.png" height="21" width="21"></a>Fork symbol at the top right corner.

**2.** Clone your new fork of the repository in the terminal/CLI on your computer with the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/Code-Outside
```

**3.** Navigate to the newly created LinkFree project directory:

```bash
cd Code-Outside
```

**7.** Make your changes to the source code.

**8.** Stage your changes:

‚ö†Ô∏è **Make sure** not to commit `package.json` or `package-lock.json` file

‚ö†Ô∏è **Make sure** not to run the commands `git add .` or `git add *`

> Instead, stage your changes for each file/folder
>
> By using public path it means it will add all files and folders under that folder, it is better to be specific

```bash
git add public
```

_or_

```bash
git add "<files_you_have_changed>"
```

**9.** Commit your changes:

```bash
git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"
```

**10.** Push your local commits to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin YourBranchName
```

**11.** Create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)!

**12.** **Congratulations!** You've made your first contribution to [**Code-Outside**](https://github.com/EddieHubCommunity/LinkFree/graphs/contributors)! üôåüèº

**_:trophy: After this, the maintainers will review the PR and will merge it if it helps move the LinkFree project forward. Otherwise, it will be given constructive feedback and suggestions for the changes needed to add the PR to the codebase._**
